What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I found it very difficult at first to get used to the notation of objects. For some reason, I did not understand until about ten minutes before entirely finishing the assignment that when you create an object and type, for example, "newComputer : Computer = Computer(etc)" that the first instance of the word computer is the same thing as when you say "yearMade: int = 1". Not sure why that took so long to click. I also struggled with referencing the first class I created (Computer) within the other class (ResaleShop) but I poked around with it enough that it mostly makes sense now. 

Other than those two roadblocks, I found it relatively intuitive to build the objects and subsequently use them. I really enjoyed how neat it makes all my code look!
